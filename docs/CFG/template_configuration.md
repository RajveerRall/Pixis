Customizing templates involves mapping your input files onto the template layers. A creative is broken down into its fundamental elements, such as CTA, Heading, Logo, primary image, background image, etc. Customizing templates involves adding your brand designs to the templates in order to generate creatives.

## Mapping Sheet Columns to Image Components

To begin customizing the template, you need to map the columns from your input sheet to the corresponding image components. You can preview the first cell values from these columns, giving you a glimpse of how they'll appear in the creative. This step allows you to ensure the mapping is accurate and aligns with your content.

## Eliminating Junk Values

During the customization process, it's important to eliminate any junk values present in the sheet. Junk values refer to outputs that deviate significantly from the defined guidelines, such as text lengths that are too short or too long. By removing these junk values, you can maintain the quality and consistency of your generated outputs.

### Template Layers

Templates consist of two main layers:

**Text Layers:** These layers encompass the text elements you want to display in the creative, such as headings, descriptions, or calls-to-action.

**Image Layers:** These layers encompass the visual design of the creative, including background images, primary images, or logos.

### Formatting Text Layers

You can format the text layers to enhance their visual presentation. You have the flexibility to add prefixes or suffixes to the text, choose alternative columns for customization, and apply text formatting or number formatting as needed.

### Customizing Image Layers

For the image layers, you can decide which sections of the template you wish to customize. To customize these sections, you should have corresponding alternative columns in your input file for the specific images. If you haven't added any columns for the logo or background image, you can simply use the default template images provided.

## Reviewing the Customized Template

Before scheduling the creative generation process, it's crucial to review the entire customized template. Take a moment to thoroughly examine all the changes you have made to ensure they accurately reflect your desired creative output. If you notice any missing or incomplete elements, you can easily edit them before proceeding.
