To design creatives for your ad campaign, you can create a new project. The core of every project is the creative design sheet integrated into Creative Feed Generator. Based on these design templates, new creatives are generated in bulk.

## Create a New Project

Follow these detailed steps to initiate a new project:

1. **Project Naming:** Choose a descriptive and meaningful name for your project to facilitate easy identification and management as you scale.
2. **Input File Formats:** Add your design sheet in one of the supported formats: Google Sheet, XML, or CSV.

## Configure the Input File

After creating the project, you land on configure input file step. Here you can consider modifying the column headings in the input file for improved clarity and understanding. For example:

| Original Column Header | Updated Column Header       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Headline_1             | Product_Name                |
| Description            | Ad Copy                     |
| CTA                    | Buy now                     |

### Steps to Generate Creatives

To generate creatives, follow these steps once you have set up the design sheet and project:

1. [Templates](templates.md): Customize the creative output by selecting templates, configuring existing ones, and previewing the generation. You can also request new templates.

2. [Schedule & Configure output](output_file_config.md): You can generate creatives at scheduled intervals as well as save output files and set up notifications for seamless monitoring.
