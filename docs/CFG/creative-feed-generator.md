### Configure input file 

Once your input sheet is uploaded, this is where you review and configure it. You'll see the columns, and you can assign user-friendly names to each. It's an essential step in customizing the data according to your preferences.

### Select template 

Moving on to template selection, you can choose from existing templates or request a tailor-made one. If you opt for the latter, provide details or upload a reference image. This ensures the output aligns seamlessly with your brand requirements.

### Configure template

Now comes the crucial step of configuring the selected template. Define text and images for each layer, and preview the changes. You have the flexibility to adjust configurations according to your preferences.

### Template selection review 

With the template configured, it's time to generate a preview of the output. Review the results, and if needed, eliminate any undesired outputs. This step allows you to fine-tune the final output before moving forward.

### Schedule run & output configuration

Thinking ahead, we provide a scheduling option. Choose between a one-time run or recurring runs based on your preferences. This functionality seamlessly integrates with your ads manager, offering flexibility in content delivery.
